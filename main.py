# Question 1: A string is a data type that stores words and is writien within double quotes, they can also be written within
# single quotes but,
# the single quotes help in printing the double quotes i a string if any present
# A variable is a data type that is used for storing data they are by default in strings and can be changed by
# specifying the data type that is required.

#Question 3 : 23
#Question 4: spamspamspam (ii) spamspamspam
#Question 5 :  variables are usually in string format whereas 100 is an int hence 'eggs' is a valid variable name
#Question 6: 99 is not a string so can't be concatenated
#Question 7:
# spam = int(input("Enter your value: "))
# if(spam == 1):
#     print("Hello")
# elif(spam ==2):
#     print("Howdy")
# else:
#     print("Greetings!")
#Question 8: a break statement is used when we need to exit the loop for that iteration,
#            A continue statement is used when we need to skip the iteration for that particular value
#Question 9: range(10) will print numbers from 0-9
#            range(0,10) will print 10 numbers starting from 0
#            range(0,10,1) will print numbers starting from 0 incrementing 1 as we go
# Question 10:
# for loop:
# list = [x for x in range(1,11)]
# print(list)
#Question 11: from spam import bacon
#             spam.bacon()
#Question 12: NoneType
#Question 13: A try clause is used to suspect an error
#             an except clause is used to run the code provided the error occurs in a try clause
#Question 14:[] is basically an empty list
# Question 15:
# spam = [ x for x in range(2,12,2)]
# print(spam)
# spam[2] = 'hello'
# print(spam)
#Question 16:
#   1.'d' '3'*2== 33, 33/11 == 3 spam[3] == 'd'
#   2.'d'
#   3.['a','b']
# Question 17:
#   1. 1
#   2.[3.14,'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]
#   3.[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]
#Question 18: append is used to add an element to the back of a list,
#             Insert is used to push an element wherever in the list, the value comes before the index
# Question 19: list.remove(), list.pop()
#Question 20: A tuple is a list whose entries cannot be changed, it is represented in round braces, no modifictions can be made
#             A list has data that can be changed , represented in []
#Question 21:
# my_list = ['0', '1']
# tup = list(my_list)
# print(tup)
# tup = tuple(my_list)
# print(tup)
#Question 22: in copy() the existing varriable is changed throughout the code
# in deep.copy() a new vr with the same name is created to solve teh iteration using that value
#Question 23: empty_dict = {}
#Question 24: a dictionary is a data type where values are present corresponding to keys
#             in lists no such keys are present
#Question 25: KeyError occurs as 'foo' is not a key in spam
#Question 26:
# spam = {'color': 99, 'main_course': 98}
# if 'color' in spam:
#     spam['color'] = 'black'
#     print(spam)
